🐍 Chapter 1: Variables – Python Basics
This chapter contains beginner-friendly Python projects that introduce the concept of variables, user input, and basic calculations. Each project uses simple logic and input/output to demonstrate how data can be stored, manipulated, and used in real-world scenarios.

📁 Projects Included
📌 Project 1: Greeting Program
Asks the user for their name.

Prints a friendly greeting using the input.

Demonstrates: input(), print(), and string concatenation.

🎸 Project 2: Band Name Generator
Prompts the user for their favorite color and favorite animal.

Combines both to generate a fun band name.

Demonstrates: variables, user interaction, and creative string formatting.

💼 Project 3: Gross Pay Calculator
Accepts the number of hours worked and rate per hour.

Calculates and displays the gross pay.

Demonstrates: numeric input, type conversion, and arithmetic operations.

🌡️ Project 4: Temperature Converter
Takes temperature in Celsius from the user.

Converts it to Fahrenheit using the formula:
F = C * 9/5 + 32

Demonstrates: formula application using variables and input/output.

✈️ Project 5: Trip Cost Calculator
Collects details such as:

Number of days stayed

Hotel cost per day

Car rental per day

Flight cost

Other expenses

Calculates:

Total base cost

Final cost after adding tax (based on user-specified percent)

Demonstrates: multi-step calculations, inputs, and percentage handling.

💡 These beginner projects are ideal for grasping how variables work in Python — especially in real-life situations like budgeting, planning, and personalization.
