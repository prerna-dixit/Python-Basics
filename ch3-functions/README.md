# üìÇ Chapter 3: Functions

This chapter focuses on **Python functions** ‚Äî how to create them, pass parameters, return values, and use them to make code more modular and reusable.  
The projects in this chapter apply functions to real-life problem-solving.

## üìù Projects Included

1. **Area of Circle**  
   - Function to calculate the area of a circle given its radius.  
   - Demonstrates use of the `math` module and returning values.

2. **Calculator**  
   - Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).  
   - Shows how to pass multiple parameters and return results.

3. **Cold, Warm, Hot**  
   - Fun guessing game where the program tells you if your guess is cold, warm, or hot compared to a target number.  
   - Demonstrates conditional logic inside a function.

4. **Gross Pay Function**  
   - Calculates employee pay, including overtime logic, but implemented entirely in a reusable function.

5. **Leap Year Function**  
   - Checks whether a given year is a leap year, encapsulated in a function that can be reused in other programs.

6. **Max of Three**  
   - Returns the largest number among three inputs.  
   - Demonstrates comparison logic in functions.

7. **Random Album Selector (Taylor Swift Edition)**  
   - Randomly selects a Taylor Swift album and displays its number in the discography.  
   - Example: `1` ‚Üí *Taylor Swift (Debut)*, `12` ‚Üí *The Life of a Showgirl*.  
   - Uses the `random` module and a mapping between numbers and album names.

8. **MEXT Grading GPA Calculator**  
   - Calculates GPA based on the MEXT (Japanese government scholarship) grading system.  
   - Shows real-world application of functions in academic calculations.
